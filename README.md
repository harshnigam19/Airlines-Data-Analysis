# Airlines-Data-Analysis
The dataset used in this project is a CSV file containing information about airline passengers, their ratings, and flight details. 
This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on airline data to uncover key insights about flight delays, customer satisfaction, service quality, and operational efficiency. The aim is to help airline companies make data-driven decisions to improve customer experience and optimize services.

📌 Project Overview
In this project, we analyze a dataset containing various attributes related to airline operations, including:

Flight delays and punctuality

Customer satisfaction scores

Class of travel

Service ratings (e.g., in-flight Wi-Fi, food, cleanliness)

Age, gender, and travel purpose of passengers

The notebook covers the entire data analysis pipeline including:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib

Key Insights and Recommendations

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

📊 Key Insights
Analysis of the correlation between delay times and satisfaction.

Distribution of customer satisfaction across different travel classes.

Impact of age, gender, and travel type on service rating and satisfaction.

Patterns in service quality (cleanliness, food, Wi-Fi) and their impact on satisfaction.

🧹 Data Cleaning
Several preprocessing steps were applied:

Handling missing values

Type conversion and formatting

Encoding categorical data (if applicable)

Removing outliers and duplicates

📈 Visualizations
The project features a wide range of visualizations:

Histograms & boxplots for distribution analysis

Heatmaps for correlation

Barplots & countplots for categorical breakdown

Pie charts for proportion-based insights

💡 Conclusion
The analysis provides useful insights for airline stakeholders to:

Enhance customer service based on feedback

Target marketing strategies by age and travel type

Improve punctuality to boost satisfaction scores
